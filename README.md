this is an attempt to collect + run codes of various approaches for solving spars, reasonably conditioned, systems of linear equations.

In particular, the benchmark that we will focus on is n-by-n random 0/1/-1 matrices with about O(logn) non-zeros per row.

Methods we include are:
* conjugate gradient
* Dixon p-adic

Method we'd like to include are:
* incomplete Cholesky
* GMRES
* low factor width representations of p-adic inverses (EGGSV)
